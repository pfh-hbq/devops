### **Python ðŸ’¯ practices**

- Use production ready web-framework - Flask
- List all dependencies and their versions of the reproducible build
- Include .gitignore to skip irrelevant files in Git VCS
- Allows the use of environment variables to configure the application, as recommended by the twelve-factor application
- Include .dockerignore to reduce the docker context size
- Use Docker containers to containerize applications
